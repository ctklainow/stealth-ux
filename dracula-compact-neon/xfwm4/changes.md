1. Download magicwand script from Fred's ImageMagick Scripts
2. Follow instructions for using the script on the website (change permission bits and PATH inside the bash script, and add .sh extension)
3. Run:

		bash ./magicwand.sh 11,11 -t 45.3 -f image -r outside -c BlueViolet ~/.local/share/themes/dracula-compact-neon/xfwm4/close-active.png ~/.local/share/themes/dracula-compact-neon/xfwm4/close-active.png

BlueViolet is one of many ImageMagick's color codes (we also used turquoise2 and magenta1)
